# Fitbit Data Analysis Project

## Introduction
The Fitbit Data Analysis Project is a personal endeavor aimed at gaining insights into my daily activity patterns and identifying potential correlations between lifestyle choices and overall health. The Fitbit device provided detailed data about calories consumed and burned, steps taken, sleep patterns, and activity levels.

## Motivation
The primary motivation behind this project was to supplement the limited visualizations and reports provided by the Fitbit app. By analyzing the data collected from my own Fitbit device, I aimed to assess the extent to which I was adhering to a calorie deficit, and whether lifestyle changes were needed based on discovered correlations.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** The project was implemented using the Python programming language.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Data analysis and visualization were conducted using Jupyter Notebook.
- **Pandas:** Used for data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **NumPy:** Utilized for numerical operations and array handling.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** Used for creating visualizations, such as scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps.
- **Scikit-learn:**

## Data Collection
The project leveraged Fitbit data obtained from my personal device, covering periods of several weeks. The data included details on daily calorie intake, calories burned, steps taken, sleep duration, and various activity metrics.

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning:** The collected data was cleaned and prepared for analysis. Missing values were imputed using Sci-kit learn's SimpleImputer.
2. **Data Analysis:** Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques were employed to uncover trends, patterns, and correlations in the dataset. Visualizations, including heatmaps, pair plots, and time series plots, were generated to provide comprehensive insights.
3. **Sleep Analysis:** An additional focus of the project was sleep analysis, assessing factors such as sleep duration, efficiency, and sleep stages. Correlations between sleep quality and other health metrics were explored.

## Results and Conclusion
The project yielded valuable insights into my daily activity patterns, sleep quality, and potential correlations between various health metrics. Notable findings include correlations between sedentary minutes and calorie intake, as well as a positive correlation between sleep efficiency and overall health.
